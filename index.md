summary: My collection of Elder Scrolls apocrypha and fan-fiction.
about: |
  I should probably note that many of my texts are classified as “apocryphal”,
  that is, making up new things rather than analyzing existing lore. It’s
  totally fine to reject apocrypha, and whether or not you add my works to your
  perception of Tamriel is entirely up to you.

I started writing in the *Elder Scrolls* universe in the fall of 2012, when I
found a (now-defunct) “Tamriel Scholars’ Guild” roleplaying group on reddit.
While this began as an exercise in community hangout and a very silly way to
attempt a multi-player TES game (before *Elder Scrolls Online* was ever a
thing), my inability to do things by halves soon meant that what began as
brushing up on my character’s existence in the world soon turned into a much
deeper interest.

I happened to roll Orsimer for my character, and I rapidly became [/r/teslore]’s
“the” go-to guy for the species. I also became friends with another of the TSG
players, [/u/numinit], who helped me learn Sass and Ruby and become the
maintainer of the subreddit’s CSS.

In addition to my behind-the-scenes work on /r/teslore’s visual appearance, I
also improved my writing and understanding of the series meta-canon by hanging
out in the Memospore chatrooms. Most of my posts from late 2013 on are in the
/r/teslore [Compendium] (specifically [my section]), and two are in the much,
much narrower [Suggested Reading] list.

I started drifting away from the community as university wound down, and
ultimately lost the habit entirely shortly after starting work. I miss it, and I
hope I’ll have the time and energy to get back into it.

This was a significant and meaningful part of my life during university. Even
though it was relatively short, I really did pour my heart into my writing and
my friends there. I hope you’ll enjoy these.
