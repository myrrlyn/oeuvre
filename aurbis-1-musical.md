summary: My extrapolation of the Elder Scrolls divinities as musical Tones.
about: |
  This is probably the text for which I am most well known. Which is somewhat
  ironic, since I set out to be the Orc guy and am not a music theorist. Despite
  my repeated entreaties for people to *not* use it as a foundation for their
  own thoughts, though, I’ve seen it used as a base reference for numerous other
  posts and it’s virtually guaranteed to get referenced whenever the topic comes
  up. Oh well.

  Still, I made this up out of whole cloth and no sleep. I feel obligated to
  have that disclaimer posted. It gets even wilder for the sequel.

  The inspiration for these two posts came from some MK stories on `#memospore`.
  They are attached at the end of the piece.

Play the above music before you start.

Music is the underlying force of the TES universe. It has laws and structures
governing its function in the world just as physics does. This is my effort to
describe the Theory of Music.

## The Octave

The octave is used both on Earth and in Mundus as a perfect set. 8 has abundant
significance in numerology. So let's assume that Mundus keeps the eight gods,
eight notes pattern.

The problem is that the octave goes CDEFGABC. See the problem? C happens twice.
This is true in any transposed octave. So using the Imperial pantheon of
Akatosh, Arkay, Dibella, Julianos, Mara, Kynareth, Stendarr, and Zenithar, I
chose to take Dibella and Mara as the twin C notes, as they are the most
similar-yet-different gods.

So our octave goes like this

> **C** Mara

{:.piano-key .aedra}

<!-- -->

> **D** Zenithar

{:.piano-key .aedra}

<!-- -->

> **E** Arkay

{:.piano-key .aedra}

<!-- -->

> **F** Kyne

{:.piano-key .aedra}

<!-- -->

> **G** Stendarr

{:.piano-key .aedra}

<!-- -->

> **A** Akatosh

{:.piano-key .aedra}

<!-- -->

> **B** Julianos

{:.piano-key .aedra}

<!-- -->

> **C** Dibella

{:.piano-key .aedra}

Why this ordering, you ask? I explained Mara/Dibella as C above, but let’s
expand on this.

Akatosh is the **fundamental tuning pitch** of this entire system. In the
beginning of pitch-standardization, pitches were based off organ pipe heights.
A, 440Hz, was an eight-foot pipe. Ada-Mantia as a Tower would be the tuning
length for Akatosh, A.

So with Akatosh defined as the A note of any octave, the rest begins to fall
into place.

C,E,G make a third, and so I wanted some of the more basic gods in there. Arkay,
life/death, and Stendarr, mercy and fortitude, fit well with the “feel” of the
CEG chord (it is strong and works very well, but not very “pretty”).

F, however is a pretty note, and so that’s where Kyne went. F is also the third
Important note of the scale (F, G, and A are basically the stars of the show).
With Kyne as F, Mara became low C and Dibella high C. (Incidentally, a perfect
fourth, C-F, is exactly a half-octave, so the waves resonate very well with each
other. Mara, handmaiden of Kyne, fits here perfectly.)

This leaves D and B open, and Zenithar and Julianos to be placed. I placed
Julianos next to Akatosh and Dibella, since his sphere of intellectual work is
close (sort of) to Beauty and the Fundamental. Zenithar, labor, goes well next
to Arkay's life/death and Mara's family.

## The Accidentals

This is where we break off **markedly** from the music you know. Western canon
uses the 12-tone C C♯ D D♯ E F F♯ G G♯ A A♯ B octave. This only has five
accidentals, which is where the Daedra go. The Daedra are in the set of
Creation, but their tones are alien to it and can work for or against it,
depending on use. Daedra fit very well as accidentals. However, we need sixteen.
To this end, we turn to the 24-tone scale, C C♯ C♯♯ C♯♯♯ D D♯ D♯♯♯ D♯♯♯ E E♯ F
F♯ F♯♯ F♯♯♯ G G♯ G♯♯ G♯♯♯ A A♯ A♯♯ A♯♯♯ B B♯. In this scale, the double sharps
\[n\]♯♯ correspond with the single sharps \[n\]♯ of the 12-tone. Note that every
note of the twelve-tone now has a halfway note to its right, including the
formerly-accidental-free note pairs of B/C and E/F.

We have sixteen-and-one Daedra depending on how you count Sheogorath/Jyggalag.
And while the description of the Wheel as having eight Spokes and sixteen
Spoke-Voids may make you think there are two voids between each spoke, this does
not necessarily have to be true. The octave is not evenly spaced for the primal
chords, so the Wheel Spokes are not rotationally symmetric. Their spacing is not
made less beautiful as a result. Rather, this asymmetry is what makes the Octave
as a whole more special.

Notice how the Four Corners of the House of Troubles and the Three Good Daedra
fall into place exactly in between the Aedric Tones. My placement logic for the
Daedra is as follows:

The 4CotHoT and 3GD are not necessarily placed HGHGHGH, as rotational symmetry
is unneeded.

The seven selected Daedra are to go in the seven gaps-between-Aedric-Tones, and
are to be neighbored by Aedra whose properties are similar to their own. Mara is
familial, and Zenithar governs labor. Malacath embodies both of those.
Zenithar’s work and Arkay’s life/death are both touched by Mehrunes Dagon’s
destruction (ruining the former, speeding the latter). Azura, Twilight, is
similar to Arkay and Kyne’s Wind. And so forth.

The ten remnant Daedra are to be attached to the five Daedra who have room for
quarter-tones. **Again, note that in the 12-tone octave, there is no**
**accidental between E/F and B/C, so in the 24-tone, E♯ and B♯ are the**
**quarter-tones and cannot have tertiary notes.** Namira and Vaermina are
associated with ostracism and persecution, and are placed to either side of
Malacath by what they destroy. Namira destroys families, and Vaermina labor.
Clavicus Vile is bad bartering to Zenithar’s good, and Peryite is illness and
death. And so forth.

For the purposes of this list, accidentals are left-associative. Thus, n♯♭ is n,
raised one-half, lowered one-quarter.

Incidentally, if one makes this list into a wheel, with Aedric overtones as the
longest spokes, the 7 Prominent Daedra with spokes of middling length, and the
ten remaining Princes as the shortest spokes, one gets this result:

!["A wheel diagram of the Tones, centered on C"][wheel-tone-c]{:.full-width}

However, if we rotate so that D is our top, the end result is reflectively
symmetric. D Major is incidentally commonly called the Heavenly Key in the
Western music canon, and having Work in such a subtly special place is rather
fitting in my opinion.

## Lorkhan

There is more to music than just the tones. The beat, the rhythm, the measure,
all terms for one underlying piece: tones alone are nothing without the
foundation given by the drumline. And this is, of course, the Ninth God, the
Doom Drum, Lorkhan. (It is pretty ironic that the Space God provides the music’s
Time, but Time and Space are intermingled oddly here) Lorkhan is not a Tone, but
the Sound-without-Tone, the Pulse. Separate from the Octave and just as
necessary to the Performance as it.

## Towers

MK has stated that the Towers are like maestros, performing and conducting the
Song of Creation. They can be compared to roles in an Orchestra, and I will do
so here.

<div id="outro"></div>

(Now play this music.)

### DIVINE

- Ada-Mantia: Tuning Note of the Octave, the Conductor.

- Red Mountain: Beat of the Song, the Percussion.

### MORTAL

- White-Gold Tower: the Trumpets, proclaiming glory far and wide.

- Crystal-Like-Law: the Flutes, structured yet elegant.

- Green-Sap: the Strings, glorying in wood and gut and hair.

- Snow-Throat: the Horns, a rich warbling sound, melodic and majestic without
  seizing attention.

- Orichalc: the Trombones, deep and powerful and alien-yet-alike to the rest of
  the Orchestra.

- Numidium: the Tubas, strong and dominant, punctuating the song with brassy
  power.

- Khajiit: the Tuned Percussion, working with the Drums yet playing Tones.

- Unknown: Unknown

In conclusion, I present to you the Orchestra of the Aurbis, in structure and
form. The Song goes ever onwards, and though sections may be silenced, silence
is ever a part of music. So long as the Conductor stands, the Song will go on.
The [coda] of a kalpic movement does not necessarily herald the conclusion of
the Performance, but merely provides an opportunity for a new movement, a new
expression of the Great Song, to be played. The Symphony is complete in and of
itself, and can never be destroyed. All they require, is an Audience.

All it requires, is us.

Q: In musical terms, would you say that the Void is subgradiated noise, pure
silence, or something else entirely?

> A: I would say it’s deafness. Which is why people that travel there get
> sensorily unraveled. Wait, better: try not to imagine a world without music.

Q: Could the Towers be construed as Tuning Forks, given your music statement
yesterday?

> A: yes, maybe. more like maestros

Q: How does the Sharmat’s line I AM OLDER THAN MUSIC tie in with the concept of
Music as a fundamental element of the world?

> A: Nice one. He’s ego-trippin’ and balls-trippin’ at the same time. Remember,
> that quote is from the Sermons. Consider the source.
