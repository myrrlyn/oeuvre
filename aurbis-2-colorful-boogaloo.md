summary: My exploration of the Elder Scrolls divinities as Colors.

  The momentum from the previous post on Music carried me into messing with
  Color as well. This one is even more made up than the last.

  MK is actually color/sound synæsthetic, so having him find this piece
  acceptable was a huge relief. Me, I’m partially colorblind.

  them by hand; as part of hosting them here, I have rebuilt the images in SVG
  and added some additional flair. The rainbow used for the color wheel is a
  model originally written by [Mike Bostock].

Same soundtrack as the first one.

## Introduction

In keeping with the spirit of writing esoteric extrapolations late at night, I
present to you the sequel of [*Aurbis: The Musical*] concerning the Gods as
Tones: the synæsthesia of Gods, Tones, and Colors. We know that the Magne-Ge are
colors, and given that synæsthesia seems to be a profound mechanic of the
universe (Tonal Architecture is the synæsthesia of Sound and Touch, for
instance), I arrived at the conclusion that the Tones and Colors are merely two
physical translations of the Gods.

## Foundation

If you haven’t, reread *Aurbis: The Musical* and familiarize yourself with the
musical listing of the gods.

Now, some other resources:

- [Sonochromatism][sonochrome] – the mapping of sound to color.

- I made this wheel to serve as a visual representation of the list of God-Tones
  from Aurbis 1. The longest, white spokes represent the Aedra; the middle,
  black, spokes are the Four Corners of the House of Troubles and the Three Good
  Daedra; the shortest, grey, spokes are the remaining Daedra.

## Theory

### Lorkhan, the Beat

Before I delve into the meat of this post, I want to quickly cover one thing.
Look at the blank Wheel. See how the Aedric Tones are long, the 7 Prominent
Daedra are middling, and the 10 Lesser Daedra are the shortest?

Circles are defined as a function of two variables: r (radius) and Θ (angle).
The Gods are arrayed using Θ, but their status is determined by r. The Gods most
associated with Lorkhan, the Aedra, have the highest r-values. The next level of
Lorkhanic association (the Reclamations are strongly associated with him, and
the House of Troubles are also tied into the kalpic nature of the world, but all
are Daedra) are weaker, but still strong. Lastly, the ten remaining Daedra are
associated with the tones with least commonality and power. As with my Music
post yesterday, Lorkhan continues to be utterly different from, yet equally
necessary, as the rest of the pantheon.

### Color and Tone

I’ve taken the monochrome wheel and mapped the colors of human perception to it
here. I elected to assign the primary colors of red, green, and blue to C♯, F,
and A, respectively, and let the rest of the wheel fall into place from there. I
will explain my rationale below. For additional symbolism, and as a reminder of
the Anuad, I’ve added Anu and Padhome circling each other in the entanglement
that created Aurbis.

|     Jyggalag     | A♯♯  | 285° |         |
|   **Julianos**   | B    | 300° | magenta |
|    *Mephala*     | B♯   | 315° |         |
|   **Dibella**    | C    | 330° |         |
{:#color-table .float-right-lg .cube-helix}

Note that C♯, Red, happens to land on a Daedric Prince, whereas the other two
primary colors are on Aedra (Kyne and Julianos). This may seem a little strange,
considering that one of the tenets of my Musical Theory of Mundus is that the
Aedra are the primaray Tones and the Daedra are ~~less important~~ harmonics.
But look again at just who the pillar is: MALACATH. Malacath is formerly
Trinimiac, an Aedra, who was changed (transposed, if you will) later on.

As an aside, the number 3 in TES is extremely significant in a few different
overarching ways. One of these, the Triune House, is composed of two extremes
and an intermediary. Trinimalacath is a primarily Elven deity, and Kyne is
primarily human. Julianos, however, is revered by both Elves and Men and his
sphere (magic and intellectualism) is relevant to both.

So. Let’s talk physics and theory (and also terror. *blackens hands*).

Human hearing ranges from ~20Hz to ~16kHz, and musical notes are spaced
logarithmically (going up an octave doubles the frequency of each note). Human
color perception ranges from 4×10^14^ to 8×10^14^, and unlike with music, which
offers essentially limitless pure tones, there are only three pure colors we can
see: red, green, and blue. (A small percentage of women have a genetic mutation
granting them a fourth primary color, yellow). All other colors must exist as a
harmonic chord of those three or four base colors.

As a result, while the repeating musical scale simply represents increases in
frequency of single-tone notes, the rotating color wheel represents a field of
three-color chords. The red-green (yellow family) and green-blue (cyan family)
admixtures exist in nature as pure (single-frequency) waves, but the red-blue
combinations (magenta family) do not.

Reality does not play nicely with mythology. The physics of the Aurbis need not
map directly to our own in order for us to understand them; it is perfectly
reasonable to posit that Aurbical mortals process light in the same way we
process sounds, with a much greater spectrum of fundamental notes and greater
possibilities of chords.

I want you to visualize a helix. It’s a screw: as a point rotates in a
circle, the center moves along an orthogonal axis, creating a twist rather than
a closed loop. If you look at it from the side, you see a sine wave, but if you
look at it head-on, it makes a circle.

The Color and Tone wheels are, in fact, this helix. Each revolution is one
octave. While we can perceive many turns of the Tone Helix, we only see one turn
of the Color Helix. We can, however, assume that the Color Helix extends beyond
our perception in the same manner as Tones do, and that the Gods are associated
with their periodic Colors as they are with periodic Tones (the Octaves).

### Synæsthesia

<div id="outro"></div>

The mixture of “discrete” senses into single fields is one that features
strongly in TES lore. Pure Song is perceived as all of the mortal senses, since
this Song is what creates the world. Tonal Architecture reshapes the Song and
sculpts matter. The Thu’um translates Voice into Color and Force. Color and Tone
are intertwined in many regards and it is no stretch at all to unify them.
Furthermore, the use of cross-sensory perception in the mythos of Mundus further
illustrates the nature of the Dream state that Godhead, Anu, the Captive Sage,
and perhaps more to come experience.

## Summary

Not only can the world be described through Tone, but also Color. Furthermore,
the two are intimately related and may be two aspects of the same fundamental
concept.
