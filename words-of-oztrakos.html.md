# WANDERING THE PLAINS

On the First Dawn, the Sun rose over an empty plain of barren stone. No wind
raced across this plain, for there was no wind. No water trickled down this
plain, for there was no water. No grass grew from its skin, nor did game graze
its trails, for there were neither grass nor game.

The Sun shone on a Mountain standing alone in the plain, towering over the
desolate emptiness. Where the Sun shone on the Mountain, there was light and
heat, and where the Mountain blocked the Sun, there was dark and cold. And on
each side, at the border where light met dark and heat met cold, there was life.

As the Sun moved, the light and the dark moved with it and with them moved the
life. The life that did not move, froze. The life that did not move, burned. In
the twin arcs of Twilight, there grew clans of the First Walkers, who followed
the life-giving shadows around the Mountain. Soon it came to be that each clan
which had believed itself to be alone in the Twilight, came across the old camps
of the other, and knew that they were not alone. And one camp rejoiced that they
were not alone in the barren plain, yet the other camp wept that they were
forever separated from their kin. The camp that rejoiced left messages of hope
for the camp that wept, the camp that wept left messages of sorrow.

The Sun turned, and with it turned the twilights in which the clans dwelt. The
clans grew, and continued to leave messages for the other, and in time agreed to
send scouts along the twilight, some headed for the Mountain, and some out into
the emptiness, where they hoped the twilights would join at the shadow of the
peak of the Mountain.

The scouts reached the Mountain, and discovered that its many crevices and caves
had allowed for life to flourish there, and there were many plants and animals
to eat and rocks to use. Neither group of scouts was able to meet the other, for
the Mountain's face was still exposed to the burning light and the freezing dark
and no cave was found that reached to the other side. Some were sent back from
the Mountain to their clans, each believing the Mountain uninhabited, yet most
stayed and began to settle it. Each of their leaders saw the Mountainâ€™s riches
and knew that here, WE CAN BE.

The scouts reached the ever-turning apex of the shadow, and saw the fullness of
the Mountain and the twin lines of sustaining twilight rimming the shadow. The
clans met at the shadow-peak, and looked back to see the twin daggers of the
Mountain and its Shadow, and the endless emptiness of the burning plain, with
only the thin lines of liveable twilight lying between. The leaders of these saw
the harsh barrenness of the empty rock and knew that there, WE CANNOT BE.

# DIGGING TO THE CAVE

The clans moved into the Mountain, digging beneath its skin and carving out
homes and warrens in the rock.

Some of them were afraid of the dark, and lept out of the Mountain so quickly
that they tore new holes in it which let in the light, but were not enough that
the inside burned like the plain outside. They could never find the ways in
again and the holes they tore were too small to fit through the other way, so
now they wander the bright face of the Mountain with skins dark and burned
against its heat.

Some more were afraid of the work and of wasting away, so they held back, but
the diggers were furious and closed off tunnels behind them, so the lazy ones
could not follow. The shirkers became furious at this, and set up their own
camps in the empty halls near the skin of the Mountain, where they fought each
other as often as they fought the rubble barring the tunnels going further in.

Finally, the diggers came across a great cavern, with springs of water and
mushrooms and shells and glowing crystals and rich metal veins, and they agreed
that they had found their new home. And the two clans met in numbers for the
first time, and held a great feast to celebrate their union and their new-found
home in the cavern. But while they were feasting, there was a great Earthquake,
and all the large tunnels suddenly collapsed, leaving only scattered holes
letting in light from the outside.

One clan was angry, for they felt trapped and betrayed by the digging, and had
wanted to be able to go back to the surface and the plain of night and day and
twilight where they were free to roam, and blamed the earthquake on the other
clan, who had suggested living in the Mountain. The other clan barely took
notice, for they had never wanted to go back to wandering in circles balanced
between two opposite destructions. And the chief of the trapped ones argued with
the chief of the settled ones, and they both became so furious with the other
for being stubborn stupid that they started fighting, and then their clans went
to war as well.
