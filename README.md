# oeuvre

This is a collection of my TES fan works on /r/teslore.

I don’t know the intricacies of copyright law pertaining to derivative works,
which is what I **think** these are since they are related to and only make
sense in the context of *The Elder Scrolls*.

I’m licensing everything as CC-BY 4.0 until informed I can’t. Feel free to read,
discuss, re-host, do whatever you want with these (they’re all on reddit anyway
so I can’t stop you), just attribute me if copy directly such as in quotes or
rehosting.

If, on the off chance this happens, *The Elder Scrolls* copyright holders want
to use, directly or indirectly, anything in this collection, they are able to do
so without restriction. Attribution would be appreciated but is not required,
since this is all growing from their IP.
